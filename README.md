# Mars Rover Exploration

This Python project simulates Mars rovers exploring planetary surfaces. The rovers map terrain grids while handling obstacles and battery constraints. The project implements both DFS-based exploration (unlimited battery) and BFS-based pathfinding (limited battery), with layered exploration and backtracking logic to maximize terrain coverage.

## Summary
- Uses depth-first search (DFS) to map entire planetary surfaces with unlimited battery.
- Implements breadth-first search (BFS) to explore with battery constraints, planning efficient paths and ensuring safe return to base.
- Tracks terrain types and obstructions to dynamically map unknown grids.
- Includes visualization tools to display maps, report exploration coverage, and identify unreachable areas.
- Features test cases with custom planet maps and official STAR maps.
